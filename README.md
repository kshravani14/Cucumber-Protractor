# Cucumber-Protractor-Example



# General git flow
- git pull (to make sure you have the latest code in your local computer, same as what you have in github)
- (edit code, test, try, learn)...
- git add .
- git commit -m "bla bla bla is fixed; bla bla bla is updated, bla bla bla is implemented"
- git pull (re-assuring...in case someone else had pushed to the same branch of yours, or probably you yourself pushed some code to github repo from another computer...)
- (resolve conflict if there is any)...
- git push


This is assuming we are not using any branching flow. As... you are the only developer for this.
